# 3D-Engine

## Description
This projects features a 3D Rendering Engine that I have written using Python3 and Pygame (simple 2D graphics drawing library). It allows for the manipulation of points in 3 dimensional space. It was designed with the future use of creating a simple 3D game, and the code is written so that it is easy to utilize and understand from a high level perspective.
